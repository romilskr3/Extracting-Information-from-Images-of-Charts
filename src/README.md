# Code Repository of Our Proposed Pipeline

Our proposed execution pipeline consists of three stages: 
1. Classification of images of charts based on the chart type.
2. Extraction of chart elements from images of charts.
3. Extraction of textual elements from images of charts.

We used the PlotQA dataset available at their [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NiteshMethani/PlotQA/blob/master/PlotQA_Dataset.md).

The source code and results for each stage in our execution pipeline are represented in their respective subdirectory.

Each subdirectory also consists of its respective README.md file which provides a summary of that stage.
